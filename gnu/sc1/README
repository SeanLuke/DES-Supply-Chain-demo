charts.gnu  -- the main command file for Gnuplot, for visualizing the main time series of a SC-1 run

charts-batch.gnu -- same as above, but can be used from the command line ("gnuplot charts-batch.gnu").

other-charts.gnu -- for some additional charts (not put into the main file to avoid opening too many windows)

safety.gnu -- for safety stock charts
