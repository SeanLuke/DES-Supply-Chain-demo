This directory contain sample command files for visualizing various time series  using Gnuplot.

This is how to use them. For example, you have run the script sc-2-run-all-disruptions.sh. It has produced a number of output directories, one for each disruption scenario.  To visualize the time series for the run whose output is in charts-foo, you do

cd charts-foo
gnuplot

and when running Gnuplot, you type

load '../gnu/sc2/sc2.gnu'

This will cause gnuplot to create half a dozen or more plots, each one in a separate Gnuplot window, with various interesting time series. (Such as production of product X, order backlog for product Y, etc).


If you are not using Gnuplot because you prefer to use some other visualization software, you can still make some use of these files: if you read them, they let you figure which CSV files to look at, and which columns of them to use, to prepare a particular series of plots.
