    <h1>Disruptions in SC-2</h1>

<div align="center"><em>Updated: 2023-04-04, for SC-2 ver. 1.001</em></div>

    <p>Generally, the mechanism for providing a disruption scenario to the SC-2 application is the same as used in the SC-1 (aka Pharma3) application. (See: <a href="disrupt.html">Disruptions in Pharma3</a>

      <h2>Disruption scenario syntax enhancements</h2>
      
    <p>One enhancement from the Pharma3 syntax is that now it's possible to use the <em>time1-time2</em> notation in the first column ("time") of the scenario file in order to specify that a disruption of the same type and magnitude repeats daily on several consecutive days. For example, to describe a repeated daily attack on the EE RM input buffer of the eeCmoProd unit (e.g. mice destroying up to 10000 units of the stuff every night) occurring daily for 7 days, from day 60 thru day 66, you can write one line,
      <pre>
60-66,eeCmoProd.RMEE,Depletion,10000
      </pre>
instead of seven lines,
      <pre>
60,eeCmoProd.RMEE,Depletion,10000
61,eeCmoProd.RMEE,Depletion,10000
62,eeCmoProd.RMEE,Depletion,10000
63,eeCmoProd.RMEE,Depletion,10000
64,eeCmoProd.RMEE,Depletion,10000
65,eeCmoProd.RMEE,Depletion,10000
66,eeCmoProd.RMEE,Depletion,10000
      </pre>

<p>There is no corresponding change in the Java API; to add these 7 disruption events, you still need to make 7 calls to <tt>Disruptions.add()</tt>      

<h2>Sample scenario files</h2>
  
    <p>Sample scenario files for several of Abhisekh's disruption types can be found in the directory  <tt>config/dis-sc2</tt> under the main project directory *as exported from GitHub; that would be e.g. <tt>~vmenkov/mason/work</tt> on <tt>robo1</tt>), for example       <tt>config/dis-sc2/sample-D1.csv</tt>.
