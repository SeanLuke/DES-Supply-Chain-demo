/** Models a facility that supplies a raw material, plus the pharma co's 
    quality testing stage that handles the material from this supplier.

    <p>The Receiever (Sink) feature of this class refers to the QA step.

    <p>A MaterialSupplier does not need to be scheduled. Rather, a controlling
    element (company headquearters) needs to do 2 things:
<ol>

<li>At the beginning, call setQaReceiver(Receiver rcv), to specify the
object to which this supplier should push QA'ed material.

<li>Call receiveOrder(double amt) whenever it wants to it orders some
 amount of the material. Internally, this will push some stuff into a
 delay, which will later trigger rcv.accept() on the downstream
 receiever. </ol>
